# Feedback Management System
An object oriented C++ Program which stores and maintains course feedback provided by students. 

# Overview:
The program is specifically designed to store and manage feedback data provided by students regarding the courses offered by any educational institution. The feedback encompasses various questions related to the course, including its content, the effectiveness of teaching methods, and other relevant aspects. Once submitted, the feedback can be accessed and managed by the administrator.
For students, the program allows them to fill out the feedback form and also provides a feature to review their previously submitted feedback. On the other hand, administrators have a broader range of capabilities, including the ability to add or remove students from the system and to modify the questions in the feedback form. These functionalities are implemented through file handling and string manipulation techniques, enhancing the program's flexibility and user control.
